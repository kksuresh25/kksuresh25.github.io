I'm currently a medical student at [Harvard](https://hms.harvard.edu/). Previously, I studied Bioengineering at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/). I'm broadly interested in the applications of machine learning and computational biology in medicine and building better, patient-centered [technologies](/projects) to improve medical care.
