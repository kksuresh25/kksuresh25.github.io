Hello! My name is Krishna and I'm currently a medical student at Harvard who enjoys playing tennis, exploring the outdoors, and building cool stuff. I'm broadly interested in the applications of machine learning and computational biology in medicine. This will be where I document my experiences as I pursue a career as a physician-engineer! 

> **Hometown**

  I was born and brought up in Bear, Delaware! In high school, I continued pursuing my interests in science and playing a lot of tennis. I am an [Eagle Scout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle_Scout_(Boy_Scouts_of_America)) and naturally have went on my fair share of outdoor adventures! I also volunteered at the [Mary Campbell Center](http://www.marycampbellcenter.org/), a home for children and adults with disabilities. My time here motivated me to pursue a career in medicine and sparked my interest in the applications of medical devices in healthcare. 

> **Undergrad**
  
  I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, where I studied Bioengineering. I have worked in the [BIOLines Laboratory](https://biolines.seas.upenn.edu/) on organ-on-a-chip research and the [Radhakrishnan Lab](https://fling.seas.upenn.edu/~biophys/dynamic/wordpress/) on computational biophysics research. I also took on [projects](/projects) that aimed to build better, patient-centered technologies to improve medical care. 

> **Med School**

  I am an incoming MD candidate at Harvard and excited to see where this journey takes me next!
